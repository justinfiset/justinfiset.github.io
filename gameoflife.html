                <p>
                    <strong>Conway's Game of Life</strong> is a cellular automaton devised by British mathematician John
                    Horton Conway in 1970. It is a zero-player game, meaning its evolution is determined by its initial
                    state with no further input.
                </p>
                <h3>Basic Rules:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies (underpopulation).</li>
                    <li>Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.</li>
                    <li>Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies (overpopulation).</li>
                    <li>Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell (reproduction).</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    These simple rules can lead to incredibly complex and unpredictable patterns.
                </p>
